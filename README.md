## UX - User Experience Design

### New user

> *"As a new user I can register so that I can access registered user functions."*

### Registered user

> *"As a registered user I can login so that I can access logged in user functions."*
>
> *"As a logged in user I can manage my profile so that I can make sure it reflects me accurately."*
>
> *"As a logged in user I can create a post that appears in my profile so that other users can view the post."*
>
> *"As a logged in user I can leave private notes of a player's profile so that next time I come across them, I have a way to remember their behaviors'."*

### Registered user - Team leader

> *"As a logged in user I can create a looking for group listing so that other users looking for a group can request to join my group."*
>
> *"As a looking for group owner I can review requests to join my group by accept or declining the request so that the requester will know if they are successful."*
>
> *"As a looking for group owner I can kick a player from the group so that if they do not respond after joining, I can free the slot back up."*

### Registered user - Team Recruit

> *"As a user who has joined a group I can leave the group so that the slot is made available and I can join a different group."*
>
> *"As a logged in user I can request to join a group that is looking for a teammate so that they can review my profile and decided if to accept or reject me."*
